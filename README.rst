Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML) in PyTorch
==================================================

    The concept of deep learning has revitalized machine learning research in recent years.
    In particular, researchers have demonstrated the use of deep learning for a multitude of tasks in wireless communications, such as signal classification and cognitive radio.
    These technologies have been colloquially coined Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML) by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).
    This repository hosts two key components to enable you to further your RFML research: a library with PyTorch implementations of common RFML networks, wrappers for downloading and utilizing an open source signal classification dataset, and adversarial evasion and training methods along with multiple tutorial notebooks for signal classification, adversarial evasion, and adversarial training.

The following code (located at :code:`examples/signal_classification.py`) will:

- Download the RML2016.10a Dataset from deepsig.io/datasets
- Load the dataset into a PyTorch format with categorical labels
- Create a Convolutional Neural Network model with PyTorch
- Train the model to perform modulation classification
- Evaluate the model on the test set in terms of overall accuracy, accuracy vs SNR, and a confusion matrix amongst classes
- Save the model weights for later use

    train, val, test, le = build_dataset(dataset_name="RML2016.10a")
    model = build_model(model_name="CNN", input_samples=128, n_classes=len(le))
    trainer = build_trainer(

    )  # Note: Disable the GPU here if you do not have one
    trainer.register_listener(PrintingTrainingListener())
    trainer(model=model, training=train, validation=val, le=le)
    acc = compute_accuracy(model=model, data=test, le=le)

Evading Signal Classification (FGSM)
------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <details>
    <summary>Click to Expand</summary>

The following code (located at :code:`examples/adversarial_evasion.py`) will:

- Download the RML2016.10a Dataset from deepsig.io/datasets
- Load the dataset into a PyTorch format with categorical labels and only keep high SNR samples
- Create a Convolutional Neural Network model with PyTorch
- Load pre-trained weights (see `Signal Classification (AMC)`_)
- Evaluate the model on the dataset with no adversarial evasion for a baseline
- Perform an FGSM attack with a signal-to-perturbation ratio of 10 dB

Note that its likely that this script would evaluate the network on data it also used for training and that is certainly not desired.
This script is merely meant to serve as an easy example and shouldn't be directly used for evaluation.

.. code:: python
    :number-lines:

    from rfml.attack import fgsm
    from rfml.data import build_dataset
    from rfml.nn.eval import compute_accuracy
    from rfml.nn.model import build_model

    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

    _, _, test, le = build_dataset(dataset_name="RML2016.10a", test_pct=0.9)
    mask = test.df["SNR"] >= 18
    model = build_model(model_name="CNN", input_samples=128, n_classes=len(le))
    model.load("cnn.pt")

    acc = compute_accuracy(model=model, data=test, le=le, mask=mask)
    print("Normal (no attack) Accuracy on Dataset: {:.3f}".format(acc))

    spr = 10  # dB
    right = 0
    total = 0
    dl = DataLoader(test.as_torch(le=le, mask=mask), shuffle=True, batch_size=512)
    for x, y in dl:
        adv_x = fgsm(x, y, spr=spr, input_size=128, sps=8, net=model)

        predictions = model.predict(adv_x)
        right += (predictions == y).sum().item()
        total += len(y)

    adv_acc = float(right) / total
    print("Adversarial Accuracy with SPR of {} dB attack: {:.3f}".format(spr, adv_acc))
    print("FGSM Degraded Model Accuracy by {:.3f}".format(acc - adv_acc))

Running the above code will produce an output similar to the following.

.. code:: bash

    > python3 examples/adversarial_evasion.py
        Normal (no attack) Accuracy on Dataset: 0.831
        Adversarial Accuracy with SPR of 10 dB attack: 0.092

PyTorch Implementation of Linear Modulations
--------------------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <details>
    <summary>Click to Expand</summary>

The following code (located at :code:`examples/pt_modem.py`) will do the following:

- Generate a random bit stream
- Modulate that bit stream using a PyTorch implementation of a linear modem (with a symbol mapping, upsampling, and pulse shaping)
- Corrupt the signal using AWGN generated by a PyTorch module
- Demodulate the bit stream back using a PyTorch implementation (with match filtering, downsampling, and a hard decision on symbol unmapping)
- Compute the bit error rate

While it is a simplistic example, the individual pieces (transmit, receive, and channel) can all be reused for your specific application.

.. code:: python
    :number-lines:

    from rfml.ptradio import AWGN, Transmitter, Receiver, theoreticalBER

    import numpy as np

    modulation = "BPSK"  # could be QPSK, 8PSK, QAM16, QAM64
    tx = Transmitter(modulation=modulation)
    channel = AWGN()
    rx = Receiver(modulation=modulation)

    n_symbols = int(10e3)
    n_bits = int(tx.symbol_encoder.get_bps() * n_symbols)
    snrs = list(range(0, 8))
    n_trials = 10

    for snr in range(0, 8):
        channel.set_snr(snr)
        n_errors = 0

        for _ in range(n_trials):
            tx_bits = np.random.randint(low=0, high=2, size=n_bits)
            tx_iq = tx.modulate(bits=tx_bits)

            rx_iq = channel(tx_iq)

            rx_bits = rx.demodulate(iq=rx_iq)
            rx_bits = np.array(rx_bits)

            n_errors += np.sum(np.abs(tx_bits - rx_bits))

        ber = float(n_errors) / float(n_bits * n_trials)
        theory = theoreticalBER(modulation=modulation, snr=snr)

        print(
            "BER={:.3e}, "
            "theory={:.3e}, "
            "|diff|={:.3e}, "
            "SNR={:d}, "
            "modulation={}".format(ber, theory, np.abs(ber - theory), snr, modulation)
        )

Running the above code will produce an output similar to the following.

.. code:: bash

    > python3 examples/pt_modem.py
        BER=7.763e-02, theory=7.865e-02, |diff|=1.020e-03, SNR=0, modulation=BPSK

Using EVM as a Loss Function
----------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <details>
    <summary>Click to Expand</summary>

The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) of the symbols can be used as a loss function as well.
The following code snippet (located at :code:`examples/evm_loss.py`) presents a, silly, minimalist example of its use.
In this code, a transmit/receive chain is constructed (see `PyTorch Implementation of Linear Modulations`_) and the transmitted symbols are *learned* from some target received symbols.

.. code:: python
    :number-lines:

    from rfml.ptradio import RRC, Upsample, Downsample
    from rfml.ptradio.modem import _qpsk_constellation
    from rfml.nn.F import evm

    import numpy as np

    import torch
    from torch.nn import Sequential, Parameter
    from torch.autograd import Variable
    from torch.optim import SGD

    n_symbols = 32
    indices = np.random.randint(low=0, high=4, size=n_symbols)
    target_symbols = np.array([_qpsk_constellation[i] for i in indices])
    target_symbols = np.stack((target_symbols.real, target_symbols.imag))
    _target_symbols = torch.from_numpy(
        target_symbols[np.newaxis, np.newaxis, ::].astype(np.float32)
    )

    mean = torch.zeros((1, 1, 2, _target_symbols.shape[3]))
    std = torch.ones((1, 1, 2, _target_symbols.shape[3]))
    tx_symbols = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.normal(mean, std))

    optimizer = SGD((tx_symbols,), lr=10e-2, momentum=0.9)

    tx_chain = Sequential(
        Upsample(i=8), RRC(alpha=0.35, sps=8, filter_span=8, add_pad=True)
    )
    rx_chain = Sequential(
        RRC(alpha=0.35, sps=8, filter_span=8, add_pad=False), Downsample(offset=8 * 8, d=8)
    )

    n_epochs = 151
    for i in range(n_epochs):
        tx_signal = tx_chain(tx_symbols)
        rx_symbols = rx_chain(tx_signal)
        loss = torch.mean(evm(rx_symbols, _target_symbols))

        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("Loss @ epoch {}: {:3f}".format(i, loss))

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        tx_symbols.grad.zero_()

The code may be better understood through a diagram.

Spectral Mask as a Loss Function
--------------------------------

.. raw:: html

    <details>
    <summary>Click to Expand</summary>

Nearly all communications systems are frequency limited, therefore, it can be helpful to have a component of the loss function which penalizes the use of spectrum.
The following simple example (located at :code:`examples/spectral_loss.py`) demonstrates a *filtering* of a signal to adhere to a spectral mask.
By itself, it isn't useful as the performance is extremely subpar to a standard digital filter; however, it can be incorportated into a larger machine learning workflow.

.. code:: python
    :number-lines:

    from rfml.nn.F import psd
    from rfml.ptradio import RRC

    import numpy as np

    import torch
    from torch.nn import Parameter
    from torch.optim import SGD

    n_time = 1024

    # Create a white gaussian noise signal -- therefore ~ flat across frequency
    mean = torch.zeros((1, 1, 2, n_time))
    std = torch.ones((1, 1, 2, n_time)) / 25.0
    signal = torch.nn.Parameter(torch.normal(mean, std))
    t = np.arange(n_time)

    # Define our "target" PSD profile to be the spectrum of the root raised cosine
    rrc = RRC()
    impulse = rrc.impulse_response
    # The impulse response is real valued so we'll make it "complex" by just adding
    # another dimension in for IQ and setting the imaginary portion to 0
    impulse = torch.cat((impulse, impulse), dim=2)
    impulse[:, :, 1, :] = 0.0

    # In order to match dimensions with our desired frequency resolution by
    # setting n_time to be the FFT length -- we must pad with some zeros
    _to_pad = torch.zeros(
        (impulse.shape[0], impulse.shape[1], impulse.shape[2], n_time - impulse.shape[3])
    )
    impulse = torch.cat((impulse, _to_pad), dim=3)

    target_psd = psd(impulse)

    optimizer = SGD((signal,), lr=50e-4, momentum=0.9)

    n_epochs = 151
    for i in range(n_epochs):
        cur_psd = psd(signal)
        loss = torch.mean((cur_psd - target_psd) ** 2)

        if i % 15 == 0:
            print("Loss @ epoch {}: {:3f}".format(i, loss))

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        signal.grad.zero_()

It may be easier to understand the above code with a diagram.

.. image:: notebooks/_fig/spectralloss.png
   :height: 200px
   :width: 100px
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Overview of simplistic example for utilizing spectral loss
   :align: center

If the example is ran, an output similar to the following will be displayed.

.. code:: bash

    > python3 examples/spectral_loss.py
        Loss @ epoch 0: 20.610109
        Loss @ epoch 15: 1.159350
        Loss @ epoch 30: 0.206273
        Loss @ epoch 45: 0.039206
        Loss @ epoch 60: 0.007379
        Loss @ epoch 75: 0.001740
        Loss @ epoch 90: 0.000586
        Loss @ epoch 105: 0.000301
        Loss @ epoch 120: 0.000195
        Loss @ epoch 135: 0.000145
        Loss @ epoch 150: 0.000117

Which, again, may be more easily understood through an animation.

.. image:: notebooks/_fig/spectral.gif
   :height: 200px
   :width: 100px
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Animation of utilizing spectral loss
   :align: center

Clearly, the loss function does a great job at initially killing the out of band energy to comply with the provided spectral mask, however, it only achieves ~20dB of attenuation whereas a digital filter could achieve much greater out of band attenuation.

Documentation
#############
The documentation is a relatively simplistic Sphinx API rendering hosted within the repository by GitHub pages.
It can be accessed at `brysef.github.io/rfml <https://www.brysef.github.io/rfml/>`_.

Tutorial
########

This code was released in support of a tutorial offered at MILCOM 2019 (`Adversarial Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML) with PyTorch <https://events.afcea.org/MILCOM19/Public/SessionDetails.aspx?FromPage=Sessions.aspx&SessionID=7815&SessionDateID=564>`_).
While the code contained in the library can be applied more broadly, the tutorial was focused on adversarial evasion attacks and defenses on deep learning enabled signal classification systems.
The learning objectives and course outline of that tutorial are provided below.
Of particular interest, three Jupyter Notebooks are included that demonstrate how to: train an Automatic Modulation Classification Neural Network, evade signal classification with the Fast Gradient Sign Method, and perform adversarial training.

Learning Objectives
-------------------
Through this tutorial, the attendee will be introduced to the following concepts:

1.  Applications of RFML

2.  The PyTorch toolkit for developing RFML solutions

    - (Hands-On Exercise) Train, validate, and test a simple neural network for spectrum sensing
    - Advanced PyTorch concepts (such as custom loss functions and modules to support advanced digital signal processing functions)

3.  Adversarial machine learning applied to RFML

    - Overview of current state-of-the-art in adversarial RFML
    - (Hands-On Exercise) Develop an adversarial evasion attack against a spectrum sensing network (created by the attendee) using the well-known Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) algorithm
    - Overview of hardening techniques against adversarial RFML
    - (Hands-On Exercise) Utilize adversarial training to harden a RFML model

Format
------
The primary objective of the tutorial is for the attendee to be hands-on with the code.
Therefore, while a lot of information is presented in slide format, the core of the tutorial is code execution through prepared `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org>`_ executed in `Google Colaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com>`_.
In the modules listed below, you can click on the *solutions* notebook to view a pre-ran Jupyter Notebook that is rendered by GitHub, or, click on *Open in Colab* to open an executable version in Google Colaboratory.
Note that when opening Google Colaboratory you should either enable the GPU Hardware Accelerator (`click here for how <https://jovianlin.io/pytorch-with-gpu-in-google-colab/>`_) or disable the GPU flag in the notebooks (this will make execution very slow).

Citing this Repository
######################
This repository contains implementations of other folk's algorithms (e.g. adversarial attacks, neural network architectures, dataset wrappers, etc.) and therefore, whenever those algorithms are used, their respective works **must** be cited.
The relevant citations for their works have been provided in the *docstrings* when needed.
Since this repository isn't the *official* code for any publication, you take responsibility for the *correctness* of the implementations (although we've made every effort to ensure that the code is well tested).

If you find this code useful for your research, please consider referencing it in your work so that others are aware.
This repository isn't citable (since that requires `archiving and creating a DOI <https://guides.github.com/activities/citable-code/>`_), so a simple footnote would be the best way to reference this repository.
